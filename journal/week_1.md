# Week 1 (2/23 - 2/29)

## Day 1 (2/23)

**What I did**

- Set up repo and virtual environment
- Installed OpenCV
- Implemented Canny edge detection following a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS7zHKwXWRM)

**Takeaway:**  
An image is just a matrix, and edge detection depends heavily on threshold tuning.

**Question:**  
How do we systematically choose good threshold values?

## Day 2 (2/24)

**What I did**

- Started the Linear Algebra course for review. [Completed 10%]
- Practiced using NumPy and Matplotlib to get more comfortable with the libraries.
